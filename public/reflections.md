<h4> List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences. </h4>

1. <b>JavaScript Basics</b> - Javascript basics helped me understand how the language works, including how to write code, where to place it, and how browsers interpret it. I learned about variables, data types, and how JavaScript runs from top to bottom. I enjoyed this topic a lot because the rules were straightforward, and the syntax made sense. I feel confident in creating small programs using basic JS concepts.
2. <b>Variables and Data Types</b> - I understood how to declare variables using let, const, and var, and how each one behaves differently. Knowing the difference between strings, numbers, booleans, and other data types helped me write more accurate code. This means debugging easier and helped avoid many small errors in my programs.
3. <b>Arithmetic Operators</b> - Arithmetic operators like +,-,*,/, and % were familiar to me because they were used in other programming languages like C++. We practiced them a lot in class through coding challenges and exercises. I can now confidently perform calculations and even combine them with variables and functions.
4. <b>Console Logging and Alerts</b> - Using console.log() and alert() helped me test if my code works correctly. This was especially useful during the early part of the course. I can now easily check values and debug simple logic errors in my code with these tools.
5. <b>String Concatenation</b> - I understood how to combine string using the + operator or template literals with backticks. This helped me build dynamic messages and outputs. It's a very useful skill, especially when creating alerts or showing results to the user.

<h4> List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.</h4>

1. <b>JavaScript Operations</b> - I understand basic operations, but sometimes I get confused when combining different operators or working with complex expressions. I need more practice in identifying the correct order of operations and using parentheses properly.
2. <b>If-Else Statements</b> - I know the concept of if-else, but sometimes I struggle with writing more complex conditions or handling multiple possibilities. I need more practice to get comfortable with nested conditions and understanding when to use them effectively in different scenarios.
3. <b>Switch Statements</b> - Switch statements seem easy, but I often forget the break part or when it's more useful compared to if-else. More explanation and examples could help me know when to use switch more effectively.
4. <b>Loops (for, while)</b> - Loops are a bit confusing because they have different structures and purposes. I get mixed up with how the conditions and increments work, especially when using nested loops.
5. <b>Functions</b> - I find functions quite tricky, especially when it comes to parameters and return values. I can write simple functions, but when it gets more complex, I lose track of what's happening. I need more guided practice on creating and calling functions properly.

<h4> Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.</h4>

1. I plan to practice more on online platforms like W3Schools, CodePen, or JSFiddle. I will also do mini-quizzes or flashcards to remember operator priorities.
2. I will try writing small decision-making programs like a simple grading system or age checker. Seeing how these statements work in real examples will help me.
3. I'll compare them with if-else in code and try switching between the two to see which one is better in different scenarios. Watching short tutorial videos might also help.
4. I plan to create small looping projects like counting apps, multiplication tables, or simple games. Repetition will help me get used to the syntax and logic.
5. I will start by writing very basic functions and gradually make them more complex. I'll also write down examples and try explaining each part of the function in my own words to understand better.

<h4> In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?</h4>

<b>Effective Activities:</b>
1. <b>Hands-on Coding Exercises</b> - These were very helpful because I got to apply what we learned right away. Typing out the code helped me remember syntax and spot errors.
2. <b>Group Discussions or Pair Programming</b> - Discussing code with classmates helped me understand different ways of solving problems. It was easier to understand things when someone explained them in simple terms.

<b>Not Effective Activities:</b>
1. <b> Watching Long Videos Without Practice</b> - Some video lessons were quite long and didn't have pauses for coding practice. Without applying what I saw, I would forget the concepts quickly.
2. <b>Quizzes Without Feedback</b> - When we had quizzes but didn't go over the answers afterward, I didn't know what I did wrong. Feedback is important for learning from mistakes.
